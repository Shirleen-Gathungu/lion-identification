  [ORB Algorithm](https://medium.com/data-breach/introduction-to-orb-oriented-fast-and-rotated-brief)
 [Brutal Face Matcher]()
  Our identification system works with haar cascade library which detects a lion's face then uses ORB,which extracts key features of the lion face and we then applied BRM-brutal face matcher which was able to match and compare the lion.
