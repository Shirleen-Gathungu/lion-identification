# lion-identification

<h4>About the Project<h4/> 
<p>A system that identifies lions by extracting the key features such as the whisker spots,teared ears,scars and teeth<p/>

<h4>Technolgies Used<h4/>
  [ORB Algorithm](https://medium.com/data-breach/introduction-to-orb-oriented-fast-and-rotated-brief-4220e8ec40cf#:~:text=So%20orb%20algorithm%20uses%20a,image%20than%20the%20previous%20level.)
 [Brutal Face Matcher]()
  Our identification system works with haar cascade library which detects a lion's face then uses ORB,which extracts key features of the lion face and we then applied BRM-brutal face matcher which was able to match and compare the lion.
